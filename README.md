<h1>Blockchain</h1>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Design an application with the underlaying like bitcoin</p>
<h3>Road Map</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Code the core blockchain, create block and blockchain objects in OOP style</li>
  <li>Build an API around the blockchain</li>
  <li>Create a dynamic peer-to-peer server for multiple contributors</li>
  <li>Implement a proof-of-work system to balance users (a huge number of users)</li>
  <li>Create a transaction system for a cryptocurrency on the top of blockchain core which we have created</li>
  <li>Use NodeJS for the implementation of projects</li>
</ol>
<h3>What is the Blockchain?</h3>
<p>The Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its networks
The storage itself consists of multiple blocks of data chained together like the links of a physical chain
</p>
<h4>Ledger</h4>
<p>A ledger is a record-keeping book that stores all the transactions of an organization for example, payments, movements of assets, etc.A blockchain is a distribured ledger. The ledger is shared with all nodes that use the chain network, in this network multiple nodes connect to the blockchain core and each of them get a complete copy of blockchain ledger, moreover every nodes get update when the ledger changed by others; this concept make a blockchain decentralized.</p>
<h4>Difference between Centralized and Decentralized</h4>
<h5>Centralized</h5>
<ul>
  <li>One entity records all data</li>
  <li>The central entity has a lot of power.</li>
  <li>Full authority to fine or reward.</li>
  <li>Complete trust with the entity</li>
 </ul>
 <h5>Decentralized</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Everyone records the data</li>
  <li>Everyone has equal power.</li>
  <li>Fair and transparent.</li>
  <li>Trustless</li>
 </ul>
